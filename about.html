  <h2>Methodology  </h2>
  <p>The study will use qualitative research that combines content analysis and semi-structured interviews to understand how digital journalism reports well and ethically on child sexual assault (CSA) based on the survivor angle. The aim is to create a trauma-informed, morally responsible, and survivor-focused analysis incorporating theoretical knowledge and life experience. 

The first implementation is a content analysis of online journalism articles published in 2020-2024. A purposive sampling of 15 articles was identified among foreign news media outlets (The Guardian, BBC, CNN, BuzzFeed, and Al Jazeera). The articles were chosen according to their relevance to CSA, digital storytelling format, and the relevance of survivor representation. Special attention was paid to language, visual framing, narrative conventions, ethical deliberation (e.g., anonymity), and engagement features with the reader, including the reader's comments and sharing abilities on social media. 

The second type of research will be semi-structured interviews with five survivors of CSA who have either been communicating with reporters or shared their experiences online. The consenting patients were identified using survivor advocacy networks and were aware of the study objectives and their emotional susceptibilities. The interviews (using confidential online methods) focus on their experiences with journalistic stories, their attitude to media ethics, and the psychological influence of publishing the stories. To make their voices centralized, direct quotations of Eva, Sara and so on are merged in the narrative. A thematic analysis followed the theoretical background and narrative ethics of trauma referred to such scholars as Judith Herman (1992) and Cathy Caruth (1996). 

The focus of ethical considerations in this research was at the center of the analysis. Data collection received institutional approval, and participants were all offered emotional support material. A reflexive autoethnographic approach was also employed, considering the researcher's positionality as a journalist and a listener in a sensitive area. Through the laid-down use of the two techniques, a robust, rooted examination of journalistic practices' exposure to trauma, identity, and social discourse in the digital era is facilitated. </p>

  <h2>Project Background</h2>
  <p>This project was created by Sara R. as part of a final-year digital journalism dissertation exploring how online reporting of child sexual assault affects survivors, media practices, and public discourse. It blends qualitative research, survivor interviews, content analysis, and multimedia journalism.</p>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>The research combined:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Content analysis of 15 digital CSA articles (2020–2024)</li>
    <li>Semi-structured interviews with 5 CSA survivors</li>
    <li>Consultation of trauma-informed journalism guidelines</li>
    <li>Digital storytelling techniques and ethical frameworks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Author's Note</h2>
  <p>This project is dedicated to the survivors who trusted me with their stories, and to every journalist committed to ethical, survivor-centered reporting in the digital age. The goal is to challenge clickbait culture, empower survivor voices, and promote responsible digital journalism practices worldwide.</p>
