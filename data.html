  <h2>Digital Harassment and Platform Accountability </h2>
  <p>When sharing your story on the Internet poses a threat. It is courageous to speak up, and it may even be hazardous in the online world. Sara did not report her abuse due to fear partly. I suppose it would be trouble, though, she said. That is not an unfounded fear. According to Powell et al. (2020), gender and sexual minorities are the most frequent targets of abuse online (also referred to as harassment by the authors), particularly when they are survivors undergoing online bullying. The reaction retraumatizes numerous people, not simply the abuse. There is seldom sufficient protection on platforms. Finkelhor et al. (2022) contend that legal frameworks cannot handle the occurrence of online CSA. When a story goes out there, the survivor would likely be forced to live with it forever, especially when it is poorly handled. This permanence has to be taken into account by the journalists. The publication of the story of a survivor is not an instant. It is a computer echo. </p>
  <br>
  <h2>The Youngest Online  </h2>
<p>Why child protection in journalism is more important now than ever. Children are not only listeners of the stories. They are also readers. Bozzola et al. (2022) caution that most youths are not geared digitally to address the threats of being online. Joleby et al. (2021) discovered that the recorded or posted abuse may leave a psychological effect forever. 

It is for this reason that CSA reporting should be trauma- and child-sensitive. 

A poorly written headline or an irresponsibly snapped photo can wound a survivor and every child that looks at it. Ethical journalism is not optional anymore in times of the Internet. It is an obligation. </p>
  <br>
  

  <h2>Findings and Analysis 
<br>
Survivor Representation in Digital Media </h2>
  <p>“I didn’t even know what it meant,” Eva recalled, describing the moment her abuse was first reported in the press. “I saw my face blurred out in the story, but they didn’t blur out my voice or my pain. It was all there, for everyone to hear—but not in my words.” 

The feeling of being quoted but unheard is resounding in all of the interviews in this project's frame. Survivors consistently reported that they felt edited or remodeled into their stories so that they disappeared or became tokenistic. Another interviewee, Sara, said They made it the institution, the school, and the scandal. It is not about me. I was willing to share my experience to benefit others, but they removed essential things." 

Such personal experiences confirm those of Joleby et al. (2020), who, in their work on technology-assisted child sexual abuse, reported the strong emotional discontinuity in victims as they noted: All of me is entirely different. Such feeling, which the interviewees strongly feel in this case, indicates the misalignment between the survivors' views and how they are sometimes framed by digital journalism. 

These insights fan out of the content analysis of fifteen CSA-related articles. The sound of survivors was undermined in major news outlets, made small-print and window-dressing, mostly stripped of any expressive shadow or lived experience. There were scanty survivor-driven accounts and long-form testimony. The majority of presented victims appeared as helpless characters whose lives have been silenced in a greater institutional/legal play. 

The journalistic pattern, instead of creating a multidimensional character of the survivors in their trauma, recovery, and resistance, affected the description of them as broken or gagged. One of the survivors termed this phenomenon as being used as seasoning to another person's story. In these accounts, the survivors of CSA became symbolic props, only valuable for dramatizing the system's failure but hardly depicted as human in their full capacities. 

Eva added: “I didn’t expect them to fix everything. I just wanted to be seen as more than what happened to me. But all people saw was the worst day of my life.” For many, this misrepresentation added another layer of pain to their already complex trauma. 

When Telling the Story Hurts Again 

Survivors reflect on the emotional toll of media exposure. Sara said It is not the article. It is the hundreds of remarks that we are liars. The following tweets are the ones that have made it a joke. She explained how deeply it affects her emotionally when she reads feedback to CSA tales on the internet- panic, withdrawal, and fear, aggravated by society's reactions. Eva, who did not go public, revealed her reasons. "I am 6; it was 20 years ago, why bother when there is nothing to prove it? Maybe you only need to comprehend that you are not at fault.” 

Her air of hesitation is an ominous sign that she is anguished with the possibility of traumatization that may result from sharing her story publicly: the feeling is familiar among others. Survivors have also addressed the media in terms of anonymity and headlines. One described how she was anonymized without consultations being involved- the other remembered how the situation felt like her life was being auctioned. Such incidents are echoed in the patterns traced by Anik et al. (2021), who mention that CSA reporting is characterized by a wide gap in ethics where the story objects to the victim or deprives them of their agency in favor of sensational headlines. </p>
