  <h2>Discussion   </h2>
  <p>The research results show that although it is possible and even desirable to have ethical reporting on child sexual assault (CSA) in digital journalism, the present reality is quite dissimilar and detrimental. The voices of the survivors are often left at margins, sometimes just faceless bits or objectified in the sensationalized reports. But this research has shown that having the survivors, like Eva and Sara, a chance to speak in their own words has transformed them as they are no longer victims, but, potent vehicles of enlightenment and transformation. 

The realm of the journalists that cover CSA is extremely hazardous as trauma, stigma, and the demands of virality come together. In particular, Sara described the overwhelming toll of public exposure: the fear, the judgment, and the lack of control once her story became clickable content. Eva, too, revealed how the long silence around her experience was shaped by the absence of safe avenues to name what had happened to her. 

At the same time, the emergence of social media has provided survivors with new weapons to take back the narratives. Hashtags such as “WhyIDidntReport” and “MeTooCSA” are not only a form of testifying in the community but also the rejection of a silencing mechanism of the mainstream media. One of the main lessons to be learned is that it is critical to focus on reorienting survivors as empowered instead of being a subject of journalism. This is to transform the newsroom culture, journalism ethics, and responsibility towards digital platforms. The survivors are not the only people who survived harm; they are storytellers, teachers, and activists. Raising their agency in the journalistic processes is ethical and a matter of truth. 

Finally, CSA should inform not only about ethics in journalism in avoiding harm but also about ethics in promoting justice, healing, and dignity. It should close the distance between professional storytelling and personal truth, and it is already in the minds of courageous and clear survivors. </p>
