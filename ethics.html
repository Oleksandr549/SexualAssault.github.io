  <h2>When Telling the Story Hurts Again </h2>
  <p>Survivors reflect on the emotional toll of media exposure. Sara said It is not the article. It is the hundreds of remarks that we are liars. The following tweets are the ones that have made it a joke. She explained how deeply it affects her emotionally when she reads feedback to CSA tales on the internet- panic, withdrawal, and fear, aggravated by society's reactions. Eva, who did not go public, revealed her reasons. "I am 6; it was 20 years ago, why bother when there is nothing to prove it? Maybe you only need to comprehend that you are not at fault.” 

Her air of hesitation is an ominous sign that she is anguished with the possibility of traumatization that may result from sharing her story publicly: the feeling is familiar among others. Survivors have also addressed the media in terms of anonymity and headlines. One described how she was anonymized without consultations being involved- the other remembered how the situation felt like her life was being auctioned. Such incidents are echoed in the patterns traced by Anik et al. (2021), who mention that CSA reporting is characterized by a wide gap in ethics where the story objects to the victim or deprives them of their agency in favor of sensational headlines. </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Inside the Newsroom: Ethical Dilemmas Journalists Face </h2>
  <p>Even well-meaning reporters struggle to get CSA stories right. The majority of reporters who handle the topic of child sexual assault wish to do well, but the professional reality encountered in a newsroom does not make it easy. Reporters recalled actual pressures in interviews: time pressure, deadlines, editorial demands, restrictive word space, and inadequate trauma training. Others confessed they were not prepared to pose the right questions to survivors. Still, others reported having to delete context needed to make sense out of forensics or having to dumb down survivor tales down to a so-called news angle. One journalist said CSA interviewing was so uncomfortable that she just ran with the story. 

The other admitted that they did not even ask the survivor about the headline: "I simply thought that anonymity alone would be sufficient." These conflicts reflect what other agencies, such as the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma, have reported, as the ethical shortcomings are more likely to be caused not by malice but by lapses in structure within the newsroom practice. The journalists must be doing more than having good intentions to be able to do better. They require trauma-informed tools, time, and training. </p>
  <br>
  <h2>The Internet Never Forgets </h2>
  <p>Sara did not report her abuse-and one of the reasons was the fear of how she could live on the internet. She said, “I did not consider it valid. And I believed that it would bring trouble.” She did not want to see her maltreating family member because she had not talked about it to any person, up until this interview. Other survivors who came out to tell their experiences said that they were unable to get rid of them. As one participant put it, he mentioned that the article is five years old, yet it is still the first thing that appears when I Google myself. 

This form of digital permanence, which scholars such as Delker et al. (2020) refer to as digital retraumatization, represents a situation whereby survivors are subjected to the renewed exposure of their trauma in online archives and search engines and by reposted content. The use of social media increases the damage. Sara foresaw the reaction of her coming forward: disbelief, trolling, and her family going silent. These apprehensions are not imaginary. The findings of Ringrose et al. (2021) tell the story of the same results in young women exposed to online abuse and harassment. 

And when such malicious material is shared, in many cases, platforms do not take care of the abused users. According to Henry and Witt (2021), survivors also face significant challenges in removing the content, even when it is against policy. Too many people, being out in the open on the internet, is not only an affair of the heart, it is permanent. </p>
