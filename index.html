              compromises survivors' privacy for clicks. Eva expressed: “What is the point? Healing sometimes comes with
              knowing that it was not your fault.”</p>

              <p>
                The last thing that Eva and Sara desire is pity. It is not a rescue. It is not even conventional
                justice. What they desire is to be heard, in their terms.
              </p>
              <div class="article-box">
                <p>
                  "I do not need anyone to feel sorry for me," Eva said. "I just want people to know it happened, that
                  it was not my fault. That I am still here." </p>
              </div>
              <p>Sara echoed that sentiment. "I do not need to be saved. I needed someone to listen back then, and now.
                Just listen." The world that survivors tend to live in is very dependent on how much discomfort or
                sensationalism surrounds their trauma. They are either dismissed or are excessive. But this is neither
                therapy nor reporting: rather, it lies in those middle grounds where survivors get a chance to recount
                their testimonies without being framed as either damaged, pitiful, or uplifting stereotypes.</p>
              <p>However, a study published about the #WhyIDidntReport campaign demonstrated that sharing their stories
                with others, which many survivors did even through Twitter, liberated many users by providing them with
                some degree of control and attention (Whiting et al., 2021).</p>

            <p> To others, the repeat performance proves to
              be the healing process, not in the sense of getting rid of the pain but in wearing off the silence,
              finally. However, this has to be a survivor-driven process. The reporters must not approach such
              discussions with a messiah complex. They should treat them humbly and patiently, act as followers, not be
              leaders. </p>
            <p>Eva and Sara were willing to tell their stories not with the hope of closure, but connection. Not to be
              exposed, but to give room to another person who could read their words and not feel isolated. </p>

              <p>“I saw my face blurred out in the story, but they didn’t blur out my voice or my pain. It was all

            </div>
            <p>The feeling of being quoted but unheard is resounding in all of the interviews in this project's frame.
              Survivors consistently reported that they felt edited or remodeled into their stories so that they
              disappeared or became tokenistic. Another interviewee, Sara, said They made it the institution, the
              school, and the scandal. It is not about me. I was willing to share my experience to benefit others, but
              they removed essential things." Such personal experiences confirm those of Joleby et al. (2020), who, in
              their work on technology-assisted child sexual abuse, reported the strong emotional discontinuity in
              victims as they noted: All of me is entirely different. Such feeling, which the interviewees strongly feel
              in this case, indicates the misalignment between the survivors' views and how they are sometimes framed by
              digital journalism. These insights fan out of the content analysis of fifteen CSA-related articles. The
              sound of survivors was undermined in major news outlets, made small-print and window-dressing, mostly
              stripped of any expressive shadow or lived experience. There were scanty survivor-driven accounts and
              long-form testimony. The majority of presented victims appeared as helpless characters whose lives have
              been silenced in a greater institutional/legal play. The journalistic pattern, instead of creating a
              multidimensional character of the survivors in their trauma, recovery, and resistance, affected the
              description of them as broken or gagged. One of the survivors termed this phenomenon as being used as
              seasoning to another person's story. In these accounts, the survivors of CSA became symbolic props, only
              valuable for dramatizing the system's failure but hardly depicted as human in their full capacities.

                  <p>Eva added: “I didn’t expect them to fix everything. I just wanted to be seen as more than what
                    happened

                <p> For many, this misrepresentation added another layer of pain to their already complex trauma. When
                  Telling the Story Hurts Again Survivors reflect on the emotional toll of media exposure. Sara said It
                  is
                  not the article. It is the hundreds of remarks that we are liars. The following tweets are the ones
                  that
                  have made it a joke. She explained how deeply it affects her emotionally when she reads feedback to
                  CSA
                  tales on the internet- panic, withdrawal, and fear, aggravated by society's reactions. Eva, who did
                  not go
                  public, revealed her reasons.

            <p> Her air of hesitation is an ominous sign that she is anguished with the possibility of traumatization
              that may result from sharing her story publicly: the feeling is familiar among others. Survivors have also
              addressed the media in terms of anonymity and headlines. One described how she was anonymized without
              consultations being involved- the other remembered how the situation felt like her life was being
              auctioned. Such incidents are echoed in the patterns traced by Anik et al. (2021), who mention that CSA
              reporting is characterized by a wide gap in ethics where the story objects to the victim or deprives them
              of their agency in favor of sensational headlines.</p>

              Children are not only listeners of the stories. They are also readers. Bozzola et al. (2022) caution that
              most youths are not geared digitally to address the threats of being online. Joleby et al. (2021)
              discovered that the recorded or posted abuse may leave a psychological effect forever. It is for this
              reason that CSA reporting should be trauma- and child-sensitive. A poorly written headline or an
              irresponsibly snapped photo can wound a survivor and every child that looks at it. Ethical journalism is
              not optional anymore in times of the Internet. It is an obligation. </p>

            <p class="article-subtitle">
              In the age of digital journalism, a survivor's story can reach the world in seconds
            </p>

          <div class="article-box-m">

            <p>
              However, the question is, at what cost? The tales of child sexual assault (CSA) have always been in the
              shadows and never talked about due to the shame and complications. People today are being flung into the
              spotlight by the same stories with online news cycles, social media strands, and viral hashtags, all the
              same. The internet can be regarded as a megaphone and a minefield for the survivors and reporters. Digital
              storytelling, on the one hand, gives voices and representation. The room of silence sealed ages ago has
              been shattered by such actions as the #MeToo or #WhyIDidntReport, which allows survivors to speak up in
              their own words. However, alternatively, the expedited, emotionally intense character of digital reporting
              leads to other dangers: misrepresentation, retraumatization, and an eternity of documentation of a minute
              that survivors may not need to have anymore.

              <div>
                <p> One trauma-informed journalist, quoted by the Dart Centre for Journalism and Trauma, described it as
                  such:</p>

                <div class="article-box">
                  <p>"It is a kind of conflict between urgency and responsibility" </p>
                </div>


                <p>We have stories that we would like to be important, but we should never forget that the stories
                  belong to the person who experienced them. It is not just a matter of narrating the facts, but it is
                  all about ethical reporting. Survivors do not only have to agree to the interview, but to tone, to
                  framing, to headlines that can never die. However, digital platforms profit from outrage, rapidity,
                  and clicks, but not always at the cost of subtlety or caution. A scoping review in the International
                  Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health indicated how social media adoption in children
                  and adolescents comes with the risk of getting injured, in addition to having their trauma used to
                  create online content (Bozzola et al., 2022). Shares of CSA destitute of context or, even worse,
                  including matters that incriminate the survivor are commonplace. </p>

              28-year-old Sara added that she continues to scroll through similar posts and could not decide whether to
              open or close the screen. There are moments when I feel like telling my story. Sometimes I do not even

              Where journalism comes with the burden of truth, social media comes with the confusion of what happens
              after it. Today, cases of child sexual abuse cannot be heard only in the conventional media. First, there
              are Twitter posts by survivors, then threads on Reddit go viral, and online outcry is quicker than
              fact-checking.
            </p>
            <div class="img-box">
              <div>
                <p> However, there is a new power which is also accompanied by new danger, particularly among the
                  survivors. The internet does not forget. A courageous disclosure process can easily develop into
                  unwanted criticism, re-disclosure, or abuse. There are even more risks as far as minors are concerned.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A study released in 2022 by JAMA Network Open claims that online sexual crimes against children are
                  increasing at dangerous rates, with abusers going online to not only prey upon children but also to
                  share incidents of abuse, disguised as content (Finkelhor et al., 2022). Moreover, that is not the
                  end. Survivors who disclose tend to experience image-based abuse, as their photos may be stolen,
                  altered, or replaced with memes. This is known as technology-facilitated violence, and it is no longer
                  uncommon. Social media networks such as Instagram and TikTok are integrated into the cycle and
                  facilitate and encourage abuse with the help of weakly subjected algorithms. </p>

            <p>
              Following the words of Henry and Witt (2021), the digital platforms are governed so that PR and protection
              are subordinate. Survivors are the ones turning in their images, waving their trauma, hoping that
              something would be done by someone at the other end of the line before the rot crosses over and becomes
              uncontrollable. This digital harm plays out even when survivors are not named. "There are accounts that
              post stories like mine and act like they are doing good," said Sara. "But they did not ask me. They did
              not check if it was okay." This is the new frontier: an era in which trauma is not forgotten in the
              memory, because that is impossible on the internet, where survivors have to defend not only physical and
              mental self, but also digital self. </p>

              <p>
                The first time Eva met with Max, she was six years old. At that age, the world is small and safe. You
                believe in adults who surround you since that is how childhood works: the world made by adults,
                cushioned with innocence.
              </p><div class="article-box">
                <p>
                  “I was playing with my brother, who is your friend other than your sibling at
                  that point, right?”
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                She said with a small laugh that quickly faded. Her mother was visiting a family
                friend, a woman with an older teenage son.
              </p>
              <div class="article-box">
                <p>
                  "We loved it there. He'd buy us ice cream, candy… whatever I
                  wanted."
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>As Eva has chosen to call him, Max was 18 or 19 at the time. To her young eyes, he was fun,
                calm, and generous.</p>
              <p></p>
              <div class="article-box-m">
                <p>
                  “I never told anyone. You’re the first person I’ve told.” That one line of Sara became the heartbeat
                  of this story. As with Eva, she remained silent throughout the years. Their voices are also a part of
                  the larger digital moment, which booms across the campaigns, such as #WhyIDidntReport, and allows the
                  survivors who never reported their abuse to gather the confidence to speak out for the first time. It
                  is not only a story of trauma, it is a story of silence and what journalism can accomplish to create
                  space in which silence can be added responsibly.
                </p>

                It wasn’t until much later that Eva would realize that this trusted figure was manipulating her in
                silence. The story begins with her, but the piece is about more than one child; it’s about the
                responsibility of journalism in telling these stories and how easily those responsibilities can be
                mishandled. But one night, Max offered to play a game with them in the quiet room near where the adults
                were talking. She remembered she had to perform a stunt, and her brother needed to run behind a curtain
                to get released. And when I failed to do it quickly enough, he would find out the trick, and I would be
                a loser. She spoke more softly as she recalled.
              </p>
              <div class="article-box">

              <p>
                She paused, then repeated what she told him that night: </p>

                <p>
                  "No… I do not want to do that. It is Yukie.”

              </div>
              <p>Eva
                broke down during the interview. She had to struggle with tears, and she had to take a breath.</p>
              <div class="article-box">
                <p>
                  “The

            <p>There was no scream, no fight, no
              disclosure. Just confusion and silence that would stretch for years. It was not until she was 13 that
              Eva fully understood what had happened.</p>
            <div class="article-box">
              <p>
                "I didn't know what to do with that memory. I convinced myself I

              </p>
            </div>
            <p>When asked whether she ever considered reporting it, she shook
              her head.</p>
            <div class="article-box">
              <p>
                "I was six. That was 20 years ago. What's the point with no evidence?”
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>She looked up, her tone

            <p>Eva could
              not continue beyond that point. She authorized the sharing of her story to the fullest extent she was in
              control of, with her voice. Moreover, most stories like hers end right there, not because they are not
              worth telling, but because telling them will usually be more costly than staying quiet.</p>

                What happened to Eva is devastating in itself, but even more so because she neither had the vocabulary
                to describe it, the security to report on it, nor even the clear thought to process it. In addition to
                this, she is not the only one. Another survivor, Sara, who wished to remain anonymous, got involved in
                the abuse at the of-age 12 years.

                  “He was a relative”, she said at once, in a voice which trembled. "It started with weird comments."

              </div>
              <p>
                She explained that he was sitting beside her at one of their family occasions and touched her
                inappropriately, which left her with a feeling of ashamed and helpless.

                  Sara never told anyone. "You are the first person I have told," she admitted. "I did not think it was
                  valid, and I thought it would cause more trouble."
                </p>
              </div>
            <p>Now, 16 years down the line, she does not associate with that relative. I think it was so long before I

            <p></p>

            <p> Her statement resembles the realizations of some trauma researchers in the focus on the fact that
              children cannot usually process the abuse in the moment. A study published in PLOS ONE revealed that the
              cultural stigma and lack of understanding often cause the survivor to bury his or her story or postpone
              it, sometimes over decades (Delker et al., 2020). </p>

            <p></p>
            <p> What connects Eva and Sara is not just the abuse; it is the silence that followed. The silence caused by
              fear or shame or simply a lack of words. Silence that hides the criminals and separates the victims.

            </div>
            <p>Sara also tried to question her feelings. In both situations, there was no need to go to shady alleys and
              back streets; the rape was perpetuated where they lived, where their family members came to visit, and
              even in the presence of people close to them. In a world where everybody is determined to lay bare the
              monster, one tends to forget the most harm is usually found where you least suspect it. </p>

                Many survivors of child sexual abuse carry their trauma in silence, often for decades. According to the
                experts, the fear to be not believed, the fear of breaking family bonds or fear of being accused makes
                the majority of survivors never utter a word.

“At 12, I thought I had caused it,” Sara said. “I thought it was something about me.” 

Dr. Whitman adds, “If we want children to speak, we have to make it safer to speak. That means believing them, listening to them, and showing, not just saying, that it’s not their fault.”                </p>

                It is here that great responsibility in journalism comes in. When handled carefully and accurately, survivor tales can assist other victims to come to the realization that disclosure can occur. That they are not by themselves.

                <p>
                   Tales, such as the ones of Eva and Sara, not only break the silence but demonstrate to others how it can be done. And that is what can be made possible by a press that is ethical and survivor-focused.

            <div class="article-box-m">
              <p>The concept of a child being abused by a stranger, the unknown stranger that might be out there at the
                park or on the internet, prevails in the minds of most of the population. It is what the headlines want
                to creep into, the one raising fear, and attracting tabloid views.

                However, Sara's story dismantles that narrative entirely.</p>

                <p>

                The phrase lands heavy, devastating, but straightforward. Sara was 12 years old, and even at this young
                age, she did not know the vocabulary of the event. But what she did know was that it was not
                comfortable.

                She recalled how the relative sat close and touched her inappropriately at a family event.

                  “I froze,” she said. “I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t move.”

              Sara spent years wondering whether the experience that she went through was even worth counting.

            <div class="article-box">

                "He did not rape me," she said, then paused. "But I felt violated. I felt dirty. Moreover, I blamed
                myself."
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              It took her 16 years and immense personal growth to say his name out loud, though she no longer does.
            </p>
            <div class="article-box">
              <p>
                "I cut him off. I do not go to family events where he is there. Moreover, when people ask why, I say I
                do what I want.”
              </p>
            </div>

              Her story is more common than most people realize. The U.S. Department of Justice indicates that almost 93
              per cent of the victims of child sexual abuse recognize their offender, who is usually a family member,
              someone in charge, or a close family acquaintance.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the concept of the monstrous stranger remains the focus of media attention. It is more
              challenging to bring out stories such as Sara, who was injured in a way that is so quiet, so normalized,
              and woven into the way the family functions. They are not shock and sensationalism types found on the
              nightly news.
            </p>
            <div class="article-box">
              <p>
                “There is this idea that abuse is only 'real' if it is violent or committed by someone you do not know,"
                Sara said. "But what happened to me was real. It shaped me. It made me feel unsafe in my own home.”
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              By offering her story, Sara is not merely claiming her narrative back, but she is also battling the myth
              that CSA always has the face of a stranger. He also wears a smile when he comes to a family party.

          </div>
          <div class="article-box-m">
            <p>This project was intended to consider this question over the ethical and sensitive presentation of child
              sexual assault (CSA) on digital journalism through the prism of survivor-driven narration as the main body
              of the structure. The goal was to get out of institutional or legal stories, which seem the most popular,
              and, on the contrary, bring the individual voices that are usually pushed to the background in CSA
              reporting. Based on the interviews with the survivors, the feature was emotionally truthful and
              agency-driven in its narration. </p>
            <p>Every decision made during this process had ethical issues lying in the middle of it. Based on the
              principles of journalism and trauma covered by the Dart Centre, and the information on the moral aspects
              of journalism provided by Henry and Witt (2021), I focused on protecting the life of the survivor,
              ensuring their awareness of the exact purpose of the research, and anonymity. The list of significant
              questions for journalists covered in Appendix A has contributed to the content, and my thoughts on the
              dilemmas regarding retraumatization of the survivor, risks of the platform, and the responsibility
              involving the issue of covering CSA. The control of sharing was granted to the survivors themselves, and
              their voice became the central point of the feature. </p>
            <p>Survivor-centred media coverage of online abuse. The research conditions the structure of the article and
              the ethical setting on media responsibility, digital harms, and survivor-friendly storytelling. For
              example, Whiting et al. (2021) show how some digital platforms, such as Twitter, can present such duality
              provided to the survivors by giving them the power to speak and the vulnerability to be detected.
              Likewise, Anik et al. (2021) reveal the media's tendency to violate ethical norms, covering CSA in their
              reports, an issue that became my wording and presentation criterion. </p>
            <p>Finally, the initiative provides a journalism of compassion instead of disclosure. Coverage of CSA on the
              internet should be sexually non-sensational and should focus on dignity and listening. According to one of
              the survivors, sometimes the only thing you need to heal is knowing it was not your fault. Moreover, that
              principle was at the core of this work. </p>

          <div class="card">

            <p><strong>Sara</strong> shared how much this exhibition meant to her. “It raises a lot of awareness,” she
              said,
              and it powerfully echoes the mission of survivor-led storytelling we support here.
              This impactful exhibition challenges the harmful myth that clothing invites assault. Survivors share what
              they
              were wearing when assaulted — and it proves that violence is never about clothes, but about control.</p>

                  A moment near the end of the interview with Eva lingers. Her eyes filled with tears, but she stayed
                  steady.

                    "It took me years to believe I did not imagine it," she said. "Telling it now, even part of it,
                    helps me know it was real. That I mattered."

                  It reminds one that all the stories of child sexual abuse are complexed with trauma, with silence,
                  even with impossible choices. To a journalist, his or her motivation is not to communicate, but to
                  listen. Each story does not have to be told entirely. Not all quotes should be published. The most
                  important thing is how the story is treated, done with consent, attention to detail, and a particular
                  respect for the voice and where it is taking place.
                </p>
                <p>In the media environment where clickbait thrives, the conscientious journalist has to be tempted to
                  make the suffering exciting. Instead, they have to determine empathy based on urgency. Eva and Sara
                  gave their stories in good faith. That trust is sacred. Moreover, it is not the reporting itself of
                  the story but how the individual at the story's centre is treated during this process. </p>
