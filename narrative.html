  <h2>Taking Back the Narrative </h2>
<p>To Eva, power meant not just being silent. Eva did not tell her story publicly, and it was her choice. “I was 6, 20 years ago… what is the difference when there is nothing to prove,” she said. Other times, all you need is to be told that you are not the reason why it happened. Eva should have stayed quiet, just because in the media world, where trauma is commonly re-told without the owners, that was a type of control, the sense of gaining control over her experience. 

The other survivors in this study illustrated that platforms such as Twitter or the podcasting industry returned their voice, one that belonged to them. They did not wait until a journalist became accurate. Instead, they wrote their stories, established communities, and assisted others. This change is supported by research. According to a study by Delker et al. (2020) and Whiting et al. (2021), the liberating effects of digital storytelling can be very affirmative, especially for survivors. They can come to rupture the shame and establish solidarity. The difference? Consent, control, and choice. </p>

  <h2>Survivor-Led Movements</h2>
  <p>In recent years, survivors have increasingly taken control of their own stories. Through social media campaigns, blogs, podcasts, and online support groups, survivors create spaces for solidarity, advocacy, and healing.</p>

  <h2>Notable Campaigns</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>#WhyIDidntReport</strong> — A viral hashtag campaign where survivors shared reasons they stayed silent, forcing public conversations about blame, disbelief, and trauma.</li>
    <li><strong>#MeTooCSA</strong> — An extension of the #MeToo movement, dedicated to survivors of child sexual assault reclaiming their narrative and advocating for change.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Digital Storytelling</h2>
  <p>Survivors have found voice and validation through podcast interviews, anonymous Twitter threads, online memoirs, and private community spaces — where they control how, when, and if their stories are shared. These grassroots movements challenge mainstream media’s failures and redefine ethical storytelling.</p>
