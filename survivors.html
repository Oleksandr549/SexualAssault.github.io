  <h1>The Ethics of Telling Their Stories </h1>
  <br>
  <p>The harm that coverage brings rather than change. What is the result when the trauma of a survivor gets front-page coverage? They are known to exaggerate or tell CSA stories too quickly while gaining more clicks with too much negligence. According to Anik et al. (2021), newspapers have revealed survivors' identities to win audiences rather than sympathy. Eva, who had never complained of her abuse, said: What is the point? The healing sometimes comes with knowing that it was not your fault." 
    <br>
</p><h1>Trauma Doesn’t Follow a Script </h1>
<br>
<p>The reasons why the stories of survivors will never fit on headlines. “I thought I imagined it,” Eva said of her abuse. “I didn’t admit it to myself for years.” Her words reflect how trauma unfolds, not in a straight line, but in fragments. Delker et al. (2020) point out that these survivors feel forced to share redemptive stories. Trauma, however, does not always go in a straight line. Sara remained silent for many years. She said she did not feel that it was valid. This reluctance is similar to the findings by Whiting et al. (2021) that digital spaces may be both helpful and retraumatizing to survivors of sexual violence. 
    <br>
</p><h1>Framing the Survivor  </h1>
<br>
<p>The media can treat CSA survivors in the way of flattening or humanizing them. The manner, in which the story is told, whose voice is at the core, and what facts are emphasized predisposes us to think of survivors in one or another way. That framing in digital reporting usually narrows them down to two common stereotypes of victims: passive embodiments or disgraces. According to Killean et al. (2022), many survivors are simplified and dehumanized in texts covering media coverage. Rather than depicting them as able to withstand or being multidimensional, they focus on their trauma. 
<br>
This pressure was experienced early by Sara. She said she froze when her abuser touched her at a family gathering. I never had that bra on again. Her memory is bright, but a media headline may report only the abuse and not the courage to survive it silently over the years. Ringrose et al. (2021) and Vera-Gray et al. (2021) demonstrate how cultural tropes such as victim-blaming or over-sexualization find their way into journalism, particularly in headlines and visualization. The result? It is an objectification instead of a belief by the survivors. Good journalism can no longer be about clickbait. It must provide a platform where the victims and survivors can be regarded as individuals rather than as sources of pain in breaking news. </p>
The control of the narrative count. Survivors have to make matters of when and how to share. In the absence of that, even those journalists who are ethical will have a risk of causing harm. Part of the reason the concept of trauma has gotten such a prominent airing in recent years is that trauma does tend to reemerge in fragments, not as a unified history--not as a story that can be told--but as an event that exists to be experienced. <p></p>
As Henry and Witt (2021) observe, in most cases, digital platforms do not safeguard survivors against retraumatization. Years before, she would even open her mouth, afraid of discredit and reproach, which are supported by analyses of research papers and testimonies from survivors themselves. Even though some groups have given reporting ethics, such as the Dart Center, a high percentage of reporting outlets opt to use sensationalism instead of sensitivity. In cases where reporters do not build around dignity, they can become part of the evil. CSA reporting cannot just evade harm; it must safeguard privacy, agency, and truth. <p></p>
 

  <p>These quotes highlight the emotional toll of careless media coverage. Survivors expressed the importance of ethical reporting, anonymity, and agency over how their stories are told online.</p>
